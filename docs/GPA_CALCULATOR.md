# GPA Prediction Calculator

A comprehensive tool for students to predict future grades needed to achieve their target graduation GPA.

## Overview

The GPA Prediction Calculator helps students understand:

1. **Current Standing**: Current cumulative GPA, completed credits, and earned quality points
2. **Target Planning**: What grades are needed to hit a target graduation GPA
3. **What-If Scenarios**: How different course grades affect overall GPA trajectory
4. **Goal Setting**: Setting goal grades on individual courses and tracking against them

## Architecture

### Grade Scale

All calculations use the standard 4.0 scale:

```
A    = 4.0    B-   = 2.7    D+   = 1.4
A-   = 3.7    C+   = 2.4    D    = 1.0
B+   = 3.4    C    = 2.0    D-   = 0.7
B    = 3.0    C-   = 1.7    E    = 0.0
```

**Excluded from GPA**: P/NP, W, AU, In Progress, and any non-graded courses.

### Core Modules

#### `lib/gpa/gradeScale.ts`
- Grade points mapping (A=4.0 to E=0.0)
- Type definition: `GradeKey`
- Helper functions: `gp()`, `isValidGrade()`, `getGradeDisplay()`

#### `lib/gpa/core.ts`
Core calculation functions:

- **`computeTotalsFromTranscript(rows)`** - Computes current GPA, completed credits, and quality points
  - Input: Array of { credits, grade }
  - Output: { completedCredits, completedQualityPoints, currentGpa }

- **`requiredQPAtGraduation()`** - Calculates total QP needed at graduation
  - Accounts for completed work already done
  - Formula: `QP_target = targetGpa × (completedCredits + remainingCredits)`

- **`lockFromGoals(remaining)`** - Partitions courses with/without goal grades
  - Identifies locked courses (goal grade set) vs free courses (no goal)
  - Returns: { C_locked, QP_locked, free }

- **`distributionForTarget()`** - **Main calculation engine**
  - Greedy fill algorithm: sorts free courses by credits (desc) and assigns grades A→E
  - Returns: { feasible, requiredAvg, qualityPointsNeeded, distribution }
  - Handles edge cases: all locked, no remaining courses, unattainable targets (>4.0)

- **`formatDistributionMessage(distribution)`** - Human-readable summary
  - Example: "You need 15 A, 3 B, 1 C"

#### `lib/gpa/validation.ts`
Input validation utilities:

- `validateTargetGpa()` - Ensures 0.0 ≤ target ≤ 4.0
- `validateCredits()` - Non-negative numbers
- `validateGrade()` - Valid grade key or null
- `validateDistributionRequest()` - Full payload validation

### Service Layer

#### `lib/services/gpaService.ts`
**Authorization**: Students and above (own data only)

- **`getGpaCalculatorContext(supabaseClient, userId)`**
  - Fetches user's completed courses and grad plan
  - Returns: { currentGpa, completedCredits, completedQualityPoints, remaining }
  - Throws: `NoTranscriptError` if no completed courses

- **`computeDistribution(payload)`**
  - Validates payload and calls `distributionForTarget()`
  - Returns: { feasible, requiredAvg, qualityPointsNeeded, distribution }

- **`setGoalGradeOnCourse(supabaseClient, userId, gradPlanId, courseCode, goalGrade)`**
  - Updates grad_plan.plan_details with goal grade for a specific course
  - Stores goal grade in JSONB: `course.goalGrade = "A" | null`

Error classes:
- `NoTranscriptError` - No transcript synced
- `GPACalculationError` - Computation or database error

### Frontend Components

#### `CurrentStandingCard`
Displays read-only current standing.
- Shows: current GPA, completed credits, quality points
- "Sync Transcript" CTA if no transcript

#### `TargetCard`
Goal-setting interface.
- Number input for target GPA (0.0–4.0)
- Debounced (150ms) computation on change
- Displays: required average, feasibility badge
- Shows warning if unattainable (>4.0 avg needed)

#### `DistributionCard`
Shows required grade distribution.
- Table: Grade | Count | Visual bar
- Summary sentence: "You need 15 A, 3 B, 1 C"
- Hides grades with count = 0
- Red banner if target unachievable

#### `PlanScenarioTable`
Remaining courses with goal grade selectors.
- Grouped by term
- Columns: Course Code | Title | Credits | Goal Grade (dropdown) | Status
- Optimistic updates on change
- Shows "Saved" check mark or error toast
- Triggers distribution recomputation on parent

### Client Component Integration

#### `app/tools/gpa/client.tsx`
Main orchestrator:
- Fetches GPA context on mount
- Redirects to `/dashboard/academic-history` if no transcript
- Manages goal grade updates and recomputation
- Composition: CurrentStandingCard → TargetCard → DistributionCard → PlanScenarioTable

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Junior with 2 Years Done
- **Current**: 60 credits @ 3.91 GPA (234.6 QP)
- **Remaining**: 76 credits (19 courses @ ~4 credits each)
- **Target**: 3.8 GPA at graduation
- **Total needed**: (60+76) × 3.8 = 516.8 QP
- **QP needed**: 516.8 - 234.6 = 282.2 QP on 76 credits = 3.71 avg
- **Distribution**: ~15 A, 3 B, 1 C achievable

### Scenario 2: With Locked Goal Grades
- **Locked courses**:
  - CS 401 (4 credits, goal = A): 16.0 QP
  - MATH 301 (3 credits, goal = B): 9.0 QP
- **Total locked**: 7 credits, 25.0 QP
- **Remaining free**: 69 credits, need (282.2 - 25.0) = 257.2 QP
- **Avg needed on free**: 257.2 / 69 = 3.73
- **Distribution recomputed**: More As needed since locked courses don't all get As

### Scenario 3: Unattainable Target
- **Current**: 100 credits @ 2.5 GPA (250 QP)
- **Remaining**: 20 credits
- **Target**: 4.0 at graduation
- **Total needed**: 120 × 4.0 = 480 QP
- **QP needed**: 480 - 250 = 230 QP on 20 credits = **11.5 avg (impossible!)**
- **Result**: `feasible: false`, `requiredAvg: 11.5`, red banner suggesting lower target

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test -- __tests__/gpa/
```

### Test Coverage

**`gradeScale.test.ts`**: Grade point mapping correctness

**`core.test.ts`** (52 passing tests):
- GPA computation from transcript
- Required QP calculations
- Locking/unlocking courses
- Distribution for various scenarios
- Edge cases: empty courses, all locked, 0 target, large credit values
- Boundary conditions: exact 4.0, unattainable (>4.0)

**`validation.test.ts`** (52 passing tests):
- Grade, credit, and target GPA validation
- Course object and array validation
- Complete distribution request validation
- Error message formatting with field names

## Future Enhancements

1. **Alerts System**: Emit events when goal grades are set; later trigger alerts if actual grades deviate from goals
2. **Grade Tracking**: Compare actual grades vs. goal grades and show on-track/off-track status
3. **Multi-Major Support**: Handle multiple graduation requirements
4. **Export**: Save and export scenarios (PDF, CSV)
5. **Advisor Tools**: Bulk edit goal grades, run scenarios for cohorts
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for tablets/phones

## FERPA Compliance

- All logging excludes personal transcript details
- Logs include only: user ID, action, aggregated stats (GPA, credit count, not individual courses/grades)
- No grade or course data in server logs
- Client-side distribution shown to user only; not stored in audit logs

## Implementation Notes

### Greedy Algorithm Details

The `distributionForTarget()` function uses a greedy fill algorithm:

1. **Sort free courses** by credits (descending) to minimize rounding error
2. **For each course**: iterate grades A→E, assign the highest grade that moves toward the target without unnecessary overshoot
3. **Accumulate** quality points and check feasibility
4. **Return** distribution and feasibility flag

**Why not linear optimization?** Greedy is fast, explainable to users, and good enough for realistic cases. Students can "play" with goal grades to fine-tune.

### Data Model

Grad plan courses are stored in `grad_plan.plan_details` (JSONB):
```
plan_details: {
  "plan": [
    {
      "term": "Semester 1",
      "courses": [
        { "code": "CS 100", "title": "Intro to CS", "credits": 4, "goalGrade": "A" },
        { "code": "MATH 101", "title": "Calculus I", "credits": 4, "goalGrade": null }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Goal grades are updated in-place during `setGoalGradeOnCourse()`, then the whole `plan_details` is saved.

### Error Handling

**Service Layer**: Throws typed errors (`NoTranscriptError`, `GPACalculationError`, `ValidationError`)
**API Routes**: Catch typed errors and return appropriate HTTP status + JSON
**Frontend**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly toast/banner messages

## Performance

- **Distribution computation**: O(n log n) due to sorting; typically <10ms for 20 courses
- **Goal grade save**: Single Supabase update; <500ms typical
- **Debounce**: 150ms on target GPA change to avoid excessive API calls
- **Data fetching**: Context fetched once on page load; distribution computed on-demand
