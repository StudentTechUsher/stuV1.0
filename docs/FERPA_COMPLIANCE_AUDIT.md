## Executive Summary

‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING FERPA COMPLIANCE ISSUES**

Your application has **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** FERPA compliance issues:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ **PII in server logs** - Implemented secure logger with automatic PII redaction

üö® **Still Required:**
1. **Sending complete student transcripts to OpenAI** (third-party AI provider) without proper safeguards
2. **Missing data retention policies** for student educational records
3. **No documented consent mechanism** for third-party AI processing
4. **OpenAI file deletion** not implemented after processing

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Could result in significant FERPA violations and penalties.

---

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED: PII in Server Logs

**Status:** **FIXED** ‚úÖ

**What Was Done:**
- Created [lib/logger.ts](lib/logger.ts) - Secure logging utility with PII protection
- Updated [lib/openaiTranscript.ts](lib/openaiTranscript.ts) - Removed PII from all logs
- Updated [app/api/uploads/transcript/route.ts](app/api/uploads/transcript/route.ts) - Sanitized error logging
- Updated [app/api/send-email/route.ts](app/api/send-email/route.ts) - Removed email body from logs
- Updated [app/api/openai/chat/route.ts](app/api/openai/chat/route.ts) - Removed OpenAI responses from logs

**Logging Now Safe:**
- ‚úÖ User IDs are hashed before logging
- ‚úÖ Error types and codes logged (safe)
- ‚úÖ HTTP status codes logged (safe)
- ‚úÖ No student names, grades, or course data in logs
- ‚úÖ No OpenAI response content in logs

---

## üö® Outstanding Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Unauthorized Third-Party Data Sharing (FERPA ¬ß 99.31)

**Location:** [lib/parseTranscript.ts](lib/parseTranscript.ts:37), [lib/openaiTranscript.ts](lib/openaiTranscript.ts:35)

**Violation:**
Complete student transcripts (containing PII and educational records) are sent to OpenAI's API without:
- Documented student/parent consent
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with OpenAI
- Explicit disclosure to students

**What's Being Sent:**
- Student names (on transcript)
- Student IDs
- Course names, grades, credits
- GPA information
- University name
- Complete academic history

**FERPA Requirements Not Met:**
- ‚ùå No prior written consent from students
- ‚ùå No legitimate educational interest justification
- ‚ùå No audit trail of disclosures (FERPA ¬ß 99.32)
- ‚ùå OpenAI not designated as a "school official" with legitimate educational interest

**Impact:** **SEVERE** - Each unauthorized disclosure is a separate FERPA violation.

---

### Issue 2: OpenAI Data Retention (Third-Party Risk)

**Location:** [lib/openaiTranscript.ts](lib/openaiTranscript.ts:35)

**Violation:**
Files uploaded to OpenAI are NOT deleted after processing.

**Current Code Issue:**
```typescript
// lib/openaiTranscript.ts
const fileId = await uploadPdfToOpenAI(pdfBytes, `${document.id}.pdf`);
const courses = await extractCoursesWithOpenAI(fileId);
// ‚ùå File NOT deleted from OpenAI after extraction
```

**What's Missing:**
- Immediate deletion of files from OpenAI after processing
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) or similar DPA
- Zero-retention configuration

**Impact:** **HIGH** - Student data persists on OpenAI servers indefinitely.

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Add to lib/openaiTranscript.ts after extraction:
try {
  const courses = await extractCoursesWithOpenAI(fileId);

  // IMMEDIATELY delete file from OpenAI
  await fetch(`https://api.openai.com/v1/files/${fileId}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}` }
  });

  return courses;
} finally {
  // Ensure deletion even on error
  await deleteOpenAIFile(fileId).catch(err => logError('Failed to delete OpenAI file', err));
}
```

---

### Issue 3: Missing Student Consent Mechanism

**Location:** Entire transcript upload flow

**Violation:**
No documented consent process before sending transcripts to third-party AI.

**FERPA Requirement (¬ß 99.30):**
Institutions must obtain prior written consent before disclosing education records to third parties (unless an exception applies).

**Current State:**
- No consent form shown to students
- No privacy notice about OpenAI processing
- No opt-out mechanism
- No disclosure that AI will process transcripts

**What Should Exist:**
1. Clear consent form before upload
2. Disclosure: "Your transcript will be processed by OpenAI, a third-party AI service"
3. Link to OpenAI's privacy policy
4. Checkbox: "I consent to third-party AI processing of my transcript"
5. Alternative manual upload option (no AI)

**Impact:** **HIGH** - Every transcript processed without consent is a violation.

**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
// Before upload, show consent dialog:
<ConsentDialog>
  <h2>Third-Party AI Processing</h2>
  <p>Your transcript will be processed by OpenAI, Inc.,
     a third-party artificial intelligence service.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI will receive your complete transcript</li>
    <li>Data will be deleted immediately after processing</li>
    <li>No data used for AI training</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>
  <Checkbox>I consent to third-party AI processing</Checkbox>
  <Button>Upload with AI</Button>
  <Button>Upload without AI (manual entry)</Button>
</ConsentDialog>
```

---

### Issue 4: Missing Data Retention Policy

**Locations:**
- [supabase/migrations/20250130_transcript_upload.sql](supabase/migrations/20250130_transcript_upload.sql)
- [app/api/uploads/transcript/route.ts](app/api/uploads/transcript/route.ts)

**Violation:**
No automatic deletion or retention limits for:
- Uploaded transcript PDFs in `storage.transcripts` bucket
- Parsed course data in `user_courses` table
- Document metadata in `documents` table

**FERPA Requirement:**
Educational institutions must not retain records longer than necessary and must have a policy for destruction of records.

**Current State:**
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20250130_transcript_upload.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.documents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'uploaded',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
  -- ‚ùå NO retention_until or auto_delete_at field
);
```

**Missing:**
- Automatic deletion after N days/months
- Student-initiated data deletion workflow
- Retention policy documentation

**Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Violates data minimization principles.

**Fix Required:**
```sql
-- Add retention field to documents table:
ALTER TABLE public.documents
ADD COLUMN retention_until TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT (now() + interval '1 year');

-- Create cleanup job (run daily):
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_expired_documents()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Delete expired document records
  DELETE FROM public.documents
  WHERE retention_until < now();

  -- Delete expired storage files
  -- (requires custom function or cron job)
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

---

### Issue 5: No Disclosure Audit Trail (FERPA ¬ß 99.32)

**Location:** Entire application

**Violation:**
No logging of when student data is disclosed to third parties (OpenAI).

**FERPA Requirement (¬ß 99.32):**
Educational institutions must maintain a record of each request for access to and each disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education records of each student.

**What's Missing:**
- Disclosure log table
- Recording of each OpenAI API call
- Student access to disclosure history

**Impact:** **HIGH** - Cannot demonstrate compliance with disclosure requirements.

**Fix Required:**
```sql
-- Create disclosure_log table:
CREATE TABLE disclosure_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  record_type TEXT, -- 'transcript', 'grades', etc.
  disclosed_to TEXT, -- 'OpenAI API', etc.
  purpose TEXT, -- 'Automated parsing', etc.
  disclosed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  disclosed_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);

-- Log every OpenAI API call:
await logDisclosure({
  userId: user.id,
  recordType: 'transcript',
  disclosedTo: 'OpenAI API (GPT-4o)',
  purpose: 'Automated transcript parsing',
  disclosedBy: user.id
});
```

---

### Issue 6: Email Contains PII Without Encryption

**Location:** [app/api/send-email/route.ts](app/api/send-email/route.ts:39-62)

**Violation:**
Student PII sent via email without encryption:

```typescript
// app/api/send-email/route.ts:39-54
let emailBody = `
  Name: ${firstName} ${lastName}
  Email: ${email}
  University: ${university}
  Major: ${major}
`;
// ...
await resend.emails.send({
  from: "onboarding@resend.dev",
  to: "admin@stuplanning.com",
  subject: "New Student Submission",
  text: emailBody, // ‚ùå Plain text PII
});
```

**FERPA Concern:**
- Email may traverse unsecured networks
- No guarantee of TLS encryption end-to-end
- Stored in email provider's servers (Resend)
- Admin email account may not be secured

**Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Potential unauthorized disclosure.

**Fix Options:**
1. Use TLS-only email sending
2. Switch to secure messaging system
3. Encrypt email content before sending
4. Store in database instead and notify admin via secure portal
