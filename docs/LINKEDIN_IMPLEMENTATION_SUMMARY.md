## 🗄️ Database Schema Requirements

### Required Changes to `profiles` Table:

```sql
-- Add LinkedIn profile fields to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS linkedin_profile_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS linkedin_profile_uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.linkedin_profile_url IS 'URL to the uploaded LinkedIn profile PDF in Supabase Storage';
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.linkedin_profile_uploaded_at IS 'Timestamp when the LinkedIn profile was last uploaded';
```

### Supabase Storage Setup:

#### 1. Create Storage Bucket (if not exists):
```javascript
// Via Supabase Dashboard or SQL
// Bucket name: student-documents
// Public access: Yes
// File size limit: 10MB
```

#### 2. Set Storage Policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own LinkedIn profiles
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own LinkedIn profiles"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'student-documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'linkedin-profiles' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to read their own LinkedIn profiles
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own LinkedIn profiles"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'student-documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'linkedin-profiles' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own LinkedIn profiles
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own LinkedIn profiles"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'student-documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'linkedin-profiles' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own LinkedIn profiles
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own LinkedIn profiles"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'student-documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'linkedin-profiles' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure feature adoption and success:

1. **Adoption Rate**: % of active students who upload LinkedIn profile
2. **Upload Success Rate**: % of upload attempts that succeed
3. **Re-upload Rate**: How often students update their profile
4. **Time to Upload**: Average time from button click to successful upload

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Manual Export**: Users must manually export PDF from LinkedIn
   - Future: Integrate LinkedIn API for automatic import

2. **File Size Limit**: 10MB may be restrictive for very long profiles
   - Current: Should accommodate most profiles
   - Future: Consider compression or higher limit

3. **No Profile Analysis**: PDF is stored but not analyzed
   - Future: Add AI-powered profile insights

4. **Single File**: Only stores latest upload, no version history
   - Future: Add version tracking if needed

1. **LinkedIn API Integration**
   - Auto-import profile data via OAuth
   - Real-time profile updates

2. **AI Profile Analysis**
   - Extract skills, experience, education
   - Provide optimization suggestions
   - Match to career opportunities

3. **Profile Completeness Score**
   - Gamify profile optimization
   - Provide actionable recommendations

4. **Career Matching**
   - Match LinkedIn data to job opportunities
   - Suggest relevant courses

5. **Batch Processing**
   - Upload multiple documents at once
   - Bulk profile imports for admins

6. **Version History**
