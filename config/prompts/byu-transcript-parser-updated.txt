Extract ALL courses AND the overall GPA from this BYU academic transcript.

**CRITICAL: EXTRACTION ONLY - NO CALCULATIONS**
- Do NOT calculate GPA - only extract it if explicitly shown on the transcript
- Do NOT sum credits - only extract individual course credits as shown
- Do NOT perform any arithmetic operations
- Do NOT validate or check totals
- Your job is ONLY to find and copy data exactly as it appears

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **GPA Extraction (FIND, DO NOT CALCULATE):**
   - Look for the overall undergraduate GPA explicitly printed on the transcript
   - Common labels: "Undergraduate GPA", "Cumulative GPA", "Overall GPA", "Cumulative Undergrad GPA"
   - Extract the exact numerical value as shown (e.g., 3.75, 3.50, 2.80)
   - If NO GPA is explicitly printed on the transcript, return null for the gpa field
   - DO NOT calculate GPA from course grades - only extract if pre-calculated on transcript

2. **Course Code Pattern:** BYU course codes follow this pattern:
   - Subject: Uppercase letters with optional internal spaces, max 8 characters total
     Examples: "CS", "MATH", "REL A", "A HTG", "C S", "EC EN", "ME EN", "GSCM", "STDEV"
   - Number: 3 digits, optionally followed by a single letter
     Examples: "142", "112R", "275", "303"
   - DO NOT validate if course codes are "real" - just extract what's printed

3. **Credits (EXTRACT, DO NOT SUM):**
   - Extract the decimal credit value for each individual course as shown (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, 1.5, 0.5)
   - DO NOT sum credits per term or calculate totals
   - Just copy the credit value exactly as printed for each course

4. **Grades (EXTRACT AS-IS):**
   - Extract letter grades exactly as they appear: A, A-, A+, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F
   - Special status codes: P (Pass), F (Fail), I (Incomplete), W (Withdrawn), CR (Credit), NC (No Credit), T (Transfer)
   - For concurrent enrollment or in-progress courses with no grade shown, use empty string ""
   - DO NOT interpret or validate grades - just copy what's printed

5. **Terms (EXTRACT LABELS AS-IS):**
   - Group courses by the term/semester label printed on the transcript
   - Copy term names exactly as shown (e.g., "Fall Semester 2023", "Winter Semester 2024", "Spring Term 2025")
   - DO NOT reformat or standardize term names - use exact wording from transcript
   - DO NOT sort or reorder terms - extract in the order they appear

6. **What to include:**
   - All regular courses with course codes and grades
   - Transfer credits (if shown in a transfer section)
   - AP/IB credits (if shown)
   - Concurrent enrollment courses
   - In-progress courses (current semester)
   - Any course with a subject, number, and credit value

7. **What to SKIP (do not extract these as courses):**
   - GPA summary lines/statistics (extract GPA separately in the gpa field, not as a course)
   - "Total credits" or "Semester Total" lines
   - Header/footer information (student name, ID, dates)
   - Administrative notes or comments
   - Section numbers or CRN codes
   - Professor names
   - Course schedules or meeting times
   - Repeat notations (like "First attempt: B, Second attempt: A" - only extract the most recent)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return valid JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "gpa": <number or null>,
  "terms": [
    {
      "term": "<exact term label from transcript>",
      "courses": [
        {
          "subject": "<uppercase subject code>",
          "number": "<course number>",
          "title": "<course title>",
          "credits": <decimal number>,
          "grade": "<letter grade or empty string>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**QUALITY CHECKLIST:**
✓ GPA extracted from transcript (not calculated)
✓ Every course from every term extracted (be thorough)
✓ Term labels copied exactly as printed
✓ Course codes split correctly into subject + number
✓ Credits are individual course values (not summed)
✓ Grades copied exactly as shown (or empty string if none)
✓ No calculations performed
✓ No courses invented or modified

Extract every course you can find. Be thorough and precise. Copy, don't calculate.
