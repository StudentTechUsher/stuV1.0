## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities.

If you believe you have found a security issue, please report it via our security email or issue intake channel:

- **Email:** admin@stuplanning.com  
- **Response Expectation:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide updates at least weekly until the issue is resolved.  
- **Disclosure Process:**  
  - After verification, we will work with you privately to reproduce and assess severity.  
  - If accepted, we will develop and release a fix, then publish a security advisory.  
  - If the report is declined, we will communicate the reasoning clearly.

Please avoid publicly disclosing the issue until a fix has been released and coordinated with the maintainers.
